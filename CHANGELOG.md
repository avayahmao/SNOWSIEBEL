# Changelog

## [1.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Effort time logging in Action tab** — When updating a ticket's state with a note, you can now log effort time (minutes or hours) alongside the state change. Effort is recorded as a `task_time_worked` entry and the parent ticket's aggregate time is updated. Effort is only recorded when a note is provided.
